**process outline:**
As a basis for my process I will be using the guidelines laid out by Elsden et al. (2017), reframed through the lens of DiSalvo's Adversarial Design (2012) as well as [focus group literature]. The two key concepts I'm integrating from Speculative Enactments are social immersion and consequentiality. [EXPLAIN WHY THEYRE IMPORTANT]. However, the focus of SE is analysing experience and ethnographic work, whereas the goal of my project is to facilitate discourse and surface underlying values about the potential uses of emerging technology. This requires a different execution of the session: [Dislavo examples]

(elsden basis)
1. desiging the enactment; identify a speculation, do research & ethnography, make it consequential.[[designing speculation methods]] 
2. recruiting participants: be up front, **use counterfactual cultural probes** before meeting to communicate seriousness and sensitize
3. conducting the enactment: find a good setting, think about recording data, "be attentive to the social reality"
4. following the enactment: THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO FIGURE OUT. post-hoc debriefing, diary room [[reflection methods]]

session that surfaces internal values/politics. like **a research through speculative design focus group study**.

**WRITTEN TEXT NOTES**  <!-- %% set out my main activities and say which methodologies i will be using %% -->  
The core objective of my project is to use speculative design to surface issues, concerns and values about urba digital twins in The Hague. Accordingly, my process will be structured largely around two activities: creating the speculative design and conducting the speculative enactment.
For the first part I will use <adversarial design; co speculation; etc> and in the second part I will follow the method of Speculative Enactments laid out by Elsden (reference), which means ....

<!-- %% justify why these methods are the best fit for my project %% -->

**Speculative Enactments by Elsden et al.**
SE are an approach to speculative design research with participants. In the paper they lay out three projects to show its value. They propose going beyong discourse about speculation to developing means to act amidst it, to generate consequential moments of social interaction (think focus group sutdies).

"Speculation as a form of Research through Design and a form of provocation that creates a discursive space" (Lindley, 2015, Back to the Future)
SEs make speculation matter to the participants, encouraging them to act in the setting.
The process involves stage setting and(/or?) intervening in existing everyday routines.
They present three case studies that together show the potential of spacts as "a performance, an event and a service"
runner spots/performance: probing by improvisation. performative speculation with pofessional actors.
how they did it: hire 2 actors externally. johnston theatre sports. actors accept and integrate situations environments & conditions offered by the designer/director and create a beleivable character. here the participants are the actors who fill in the scenarios with the final informed design speculation being a video shown to design audiences who did NOT enact/participate. research value is evaluating how/why actors engaged in the speculation in the way they did.
**metadating/event:** 11 participants make data based dating profiles and engage in speed dating sessions with eachother. the research result were the "range of possible human relationships to data"?, w the participants elaborating the narrative. research value!! empirical analysis: profiles + dates + discussions + follow up interviews as data "invites ethnographic and discursive analysis" not sure how babes.
quantified wedding/service: researchers became a speculative wedding datagraphy service & participants were marrying couples they visited where they discussed what would be recorded & how etc they didnt actually go to the wedding (?). data collection: all the stuff made. they had to shape the datagrapher role in response to their participants questions. they used an *interpretive phenomenological analysis* (ipa) (Jonathan Smith, 2009) to understand individual experiences.

<!--in all of these the enactment is there to help further shape and define the speculation rather than to trigger the discussion? idk. they also had the interviews ig especially w the dating one.-->

they further explain the concept: 
a) spacts create consequences that matter to the participants through counterfactual materials and demanding social performance. this is to address the abstractness of the future that steems from its multiplicity (a challenge taken up by most speculative design work)
b) they create real *social experiences* to be empirically analysed. this is different from **Lindleys Anticipatory Ethnography** and **Odom's User Enactments** (then these might be more useful to me)
Antic. Ethnog. suggests we can "become vicarious participants in the futures represented" while as an audience theyre a step removed from being a participant in the future this problem is the experiential gulf (Candy, Dunagan) which is why the examples proposed (Contravision, Questionable concepts) suck. 
Odom's user enactments require users to enact scenarios in which they see potential futures and have to critically make sense of them. distinction here is that they are scripted & controlled limiting participants freedom in constructing it and theyre in a "lab setting" which breaks susp of disbelief. unlike with counterfactual material artefacts they're just "playing along". 
"We did not design a fictional dating website and then elicit participation with it. We designed a real dating experience grounded in speculative materials"
c) participants shape the fiction. there should be as little fakeness as possible. make it make sense as an identity the participant can identify with. not just consequential but also make participants invested
d) the staging of the enactment itself (**designing materials and circumstances)** is worldbuilding and rtd because you have to constantly relfect and rationalize how the materials and circumstances can become plausible to real world participants.
e) relying on existing routines, embedding it in ritualized activities. this helps achieve the *future mundane*. i think this is silly because it just depends on your research topic  and (imo) shouldnt be guiding. 
also theres f) ethics lamo.

they then provide guidelines:
1. desiging the enactment; identify a speculation, do research & ethnography, think about how to enact it and think how to make it consequential. prototyping and piloting with colleagues and friends (lol) and (i would say) keep prototyping during the enactment
2. recruiting participants: i dont have to care about that, be up front with them though, **use cultural probes** before meeting to communicate seriousness and sensitize. these probes are already counterfactuals!!!
3. conducting the enactment: find a good setting, think about what to record to use as qualitative and quantitative data, "be attentive to the social reality" i.e. how do your participants understand what theyre doing and how will they leverage their existing routines and understandings
4. following the enactment: do some post-hoc debriefing and reflection like using a **'diary room'** to open up discourse and help in analysis (??). also think about how to present the outcomes to a wider audience; will it be a design fiction or just a kind of publication.

they finish by pointing out hci should keep working out when this method is worth it and when an "imaginary abstract" will suffice. I can't answer this question right now. I should be able to answer this question.


HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO MY PROCESS?
-> what worries me is that theyre more concerned with experience while im more concerned with internal politics. like **a research through design focus group study**.
one thing i can do is **take inspiration from their method but adjust it through the lens of adversarial design to fit my needs**
alternatively look more at the adv des examples.
-> they also raise an important problem with UE (which is closer to my intention?) that it lacks consequentiality and freedom to the user (social consequentiality i can do) but that the scriptedness of the makes it more difficult to-NO fuck that i'm letting them interact and giving like an invested experience and its gonna be consequential as hell. **i should take this consequentiality with me in my prototyping: defining it in a way where they can actually affect the scenario and be judged for their actions, AND THEIR ACTIONS HAVE REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES. fight in my communication with the part. process to get this to happen or shape it in such a way that it feels like this. emphasize the presence of policy makers whose minds can be affected** 
-> **I should develop a spectrum of realness along which to position my enactment. identify benefits and downsides of making it more real (real =/= realistic, i mean contructed from reality and consequential to reality)** "carefully refined scripting is advantageous in probing particular values and responses, but diminishes the range of actions available to the participant and their stake in theoverall narrative of the experience." so whats more  important to me? do i need to probe for particular values?
-> i should be able to get my results from my enactment itself rather than only from discussion afterwards (material outcomes of a dialogical design process)
-> how will i sensitize my participants; **cultural probes** (Gaver, Dunne, Pacenti, 1999) as invites, already make these probes as counterfactual artefacts / diegetic materials
-> how am i gonna do the "post-hoc debriefing and reflection" this was already like my main question but yeah. they suggest a diary room whatever that means.


**Designing Speculative Civics by DiSalvo, Jenkins & Lodato**
Reflecting upon different RtD projects in speculative civics (my project is speculative civics) and discuss "thematic interpretations of civics" the emerged from the designs.
Civics is here defined as how an individual engages with governance and politics including classic polities and the "institutional void" (Hajer 2003 -> policy making outsdde agreed upon rules and norms).
Speculative is here treated as an RtD tactic.

first they explain how the projects show different speculative rtd strategies (without mentioning civics at all):

**Division of Data; RtD as *Representations of Systems Yet-to-Come***
whatever

**Data Democracy; RtD as *Prototyping Systems*** 
a prototype system that uses existing technologies to consider how new arrangements of these technologies might operate in the future. the research comes from the designing and prototyping process. "design at design time": responds to contemporary issues and thinks of an alternative way in research through *design practice* 

**Drones for Foraging; RtD as *Use of a System***
research happens through **using** the system as experimentation. prototyping occurs through using the technology in an alternative way. the researcher comes to understand potentials & limitations through imaginative staging of use. "design research after design". a mode of speculation that is negotiated between the questions and conditions motivating the inquiry and capacities of the preexisting system.
(they did experience prototyping)

then they explain how the projects prompt alternative civics strategies (without mentioning strategies at all):
**mediated civics**: civics emerging from the framing of an interaction. not interesting to me.
**computed civics**: "computation becomes the material from which civic participation emerges" systems that collect intentionally or unintentionally provided citizen input and base citymaking on it. transforming all kinds of activities into something civic. this is the typical smart city narrative. the public is understood as informational.
**proxied civics**: governmentality enabled by extra-state services. not the shaping of state based government but providing tasks typically associated with it outside the state. also outside the scope of the project.


HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO MY PROCESS?
-> i can take from **data democracy** to inform my prototyping so that that already creates research insights
-> what fucking sucks is that they seperate the rtd & civics part.
-> also its about like rtd in the design phase of design, not a design as a research tool but designing as researching. so hard to say if i can use it.


**Farias, Bendor & van Eekelen. Social dreaming together**
my session at the end according to them would fit into reflection or generative reflection which both include more than half the projects listed and in fact sometimes very vaguely.

reflection ( "non-designers enrolled into the critical space opened up by the design speculations") projects :
Lawson's Cats & Dogs [34]. focus group of expert & public (bingo) to discuss the implications
Strange Telemetry's Scenescence [60]: workshops using images of scenarios to facilitate reflection as public engagement and to capture responses. used to inform policy!
generative reflection (in-between phases of ideation and materialization, integrate feedback into design) projects:
Futures of Public Safety [26]: non-designers helped scenario selection


HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO MY PROCESS?
-> reflection projects can help inform my final session
-> other categories can help inform the design process (tho less immediately relevant to my specific intentions)




**Adversarial Design by Carl DiSalvo:** 
what is adversarial design? design work that "straddles the boundaries of design and art, engineering and computer science, agitprop and consumer products", design that evokes and engages political issues.  **Specifically it is cultural production that does the work of agonism through the conceptualization and making of products and services and our experiences with them**"
	the practice of design makes ideas, beliefs, and capacities for action experientially accessible and known
	I think this is more to further define my overall intention throughout the project than just the designing part.
ok how to use this: hes gonna examine computational examples to judge  them throughthe lens of adversarial design so ill just pick the ones relevant to my case!!!

**intervention**
this is all super useful and i think i actually wany this to be the guiding thread for my whole process. Also the examples through which he's going to explain it should be very directly applicable to my own design: the DT as computational design falls perfectly into "Information design", and also comfortably in "social robots" and "ubiquitous computing", I can't think of any thing that unites the categories more strongly. So basically I should read the whole thing but gradually as I go on because reading it all now is just too much man.
INSTEAD I will for now reason backwards from the speculative enactments (what will I need -> how to design for that) drawing upon beyond spec for actual process methods.

Chapters: 
2. Revealing Hegemony: Exxonsecrets.
   This seems to be mostly about triggering political discourse or realization by visualizing things that were already there. if i were to relate this... the digital twin itself as a visualization can become adversarial design as a data visualization revealing hegemony. of the city, the thing that it is mapping. but. i want to reveal the hegemony of the tool itself & the climate in which it exists of which it is not a map. dieee.
3. Agonistic Encounters with Social Robots "reconfiguring the remainder"
   "... expose perspectives and assumptions and make veiled issues and excluded possiblities available for inquiry and critique" (p70) this is what I want to do but not with social robots (in a way the dt is social and a robot but not what they mean here) so this could be useful.
   "With agonistic reconfiguration, the object is designed by a custom arrangement of parts, capacities, affordances, and concept in a provocative manner that purposefully deviates from familiar configurations."
   Reconfiguring the remainder is an agonistic tactic of including what is commonly excluded, giving it privilege, and making it the dominant character of the designed thing
4. Ubiquitous Computing and Agonistic Collectives: about being constantly connected to devices (least interesting). the "technique for agonism" here is articulating collectives. ?.
5. Adversarial Design as inquiry and practice: 2 directions in which to take adversarial design. 
  inquiry here meaning you give form to a problematic situation. my design will also be an inquiry woop woop. adversarial design as practice tho: "agonism as a generative frame shifts us to considering adversarial design as a process"
  honestly i think his idea of adv. as practice is going a bit beyond the scope of my project, more to inform a general design practice
  **the challenge of judging adversarial design**: (interesting) we can judge adversarial designs by how well they convey the goals of the earlier mentioned tactics. eye am going in circles. fuck all this just  look at social robots.
